During my PHD with Prof. Dr. Andreas Görling, I have been involved in very successful work on modelling of interface catalysts. 

At the same time I have been working on te development of new DFT methods. I have been involved in the theoretical aspect, as well as the programming and optimisation of these code. 

This gives my a unique spectrum of knowledge  and  abilities in theoretical chemistry, computational chemistry and surface science.  

I also have formal training and 10 yeas of experience programming with C++,  python and FORTRAN, as well as parallelisation of codes with OpenMP and MPI. 

From the point of view of computational chemistry and surface science, this method fills a gap that I had in my research work and allows me to answer questions and hence broaden my horizons in this regard.


Within the context of method development and Theoretical Chemistry, Weita Yangs work is somewhat complementary to the work of groups such as Andreas Görlings. Yet there is enough overlap to immediately understand their overall concept. 

Joining Weitao Yang's group will undoubtedly be a comprehensive enrichment of my knowledge. Since Duke University is one of the best and most prestigious, it attracts talent.The contacts and experiences I make and gain there will advance my academic career.
